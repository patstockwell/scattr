## Tags
- extend tag input using flex
- create function for removing tags from the list
- stop the form from submitting if there is missing input
- focus on input after submit

## Done
- check tag input for spaces and split the tags when adding (no spaces)
- check to see if the tag has already been added (no repeated tags)
- move tagblock to its own component
